# Brainstorm

## Content Ideas

- "Building ML systems in production" — gap between research papers and real systems
- "My dev setup" — tools, dotfiles, workflow
- "Lessons from being a founding engineer" — what they don't tell you
- Technical deep-dive on a Scam AI project (if non-confidential)

## Design Ideas

- Reading time estimate on blog posts
- "Now" page (what I'm currently working on / reading / thinking about) — inspired by nownownow.com
- Command palette (cmd+k) for navigation
- Subtle gradient background that shifts with scroll

## Technical Ideas

- rehype-pretty-code for syntax highlighting in blog posts
- next-seo or custom sitemap.xml generation
- View count per blog post (using Vercel KV or Upstash Redis)
- Image optimization pipeline for blog post images

## Open Questions

- Should the site show "Alex Shen" or "Xingyu Shen"? Currently using Alex Shen with LinkedIn showing Xingyu Shen — keeping them separate for now
- Worth adding analytics? Vercel Analytics is free but adds JS weight
