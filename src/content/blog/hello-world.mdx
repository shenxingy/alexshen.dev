## Why a personal site?

I've been meaning to build a personal website for a while. Not as a portfolio to impress recruiters, but as a space to think out loud and document what I'm learning.

Most of my work happens behind closed doors — building ML systems, debugging data pipelines, shipping features. This site is where I can share the interesting bits.

## What to expect

I plan to write about:

- **Machine learning in production** — the gap between research and reality
- **Full-stack engineering** — building things that work end-to-end
- **Tools and workflows** — what I use and why
- **Lessons learned** — mistakes, gotchas, and non-obvious patterns

No schedule, no pressure. Just writing when something feels worth sharing.

## The stack

This site is built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and MDX. It's intentionally simple — no CMS, no analytics, no comments. Just markdown files and a deploy pipeline.

The source is on [GitHub](https://github.com/shenxingy/alexshen.dev) if you're curious.
